# Script to create a qcow2 image.
#
# The main difference with the raw and qcow2 attributes in default.nix, is that
# here we only use a single ext4 partition (which thus contain the /boot
# files).
#
# This is necessary for instance to use the Digital Ocean custom image feature
# (which only supports EXT3 and EXT4).
#
# This doesn't use the same mechanism than nix-exp/exp03 because it relies on
# too much NixOS-specific things.  Currently, this means than Nix is not
# installed in the vm.

# Warning: the losetup | grep doesn't work if the same filename is listed more
# than once.

# Mmm. It seems sudo losetup results in having loop0p1 but without sudo, nope.

# This require the syslinux package, e.g. with nix-shell -p.
